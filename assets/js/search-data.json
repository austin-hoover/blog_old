          "content": "I’m currently completing a PhD in physics from the University of Tennessee, Knoxille, studying high-intensity proton beam dynamics as part of the Accelerator Physics group at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS). I previously obtained a BS in physics from Wheaton College. . Outside of physics, I’ve recently enjoyed learning about machine learning through courses in the UTK computer science department, and now through self-study. My current main non-STEM interest is philosophy, particularly philosophy of religion. In my spare time, I sometimes exercise, play chess (badly), or play piano (badly). . This blog is a space for me to organize my thoughts in writing; I’ve found this to be a useful exercise when exploring new topics or improving my understanding of familiar topics. All my posts are categorized here. . Publications . Computation of the matched envelope of the Danilov distribution, PRAB, 04.29.2021 | . Presentations . Computation of the matched envelope of the Danilov distribution, AP Group Meeting, SNS, 01.29.2021 | Parameterization of coupled motion, AP Group Meeting, SNS, 01.15.2021 | Thesis proposal, University of Tennessee, 09.30.2020 | . Recommendations . Here are some things I recommend checking out. I’ll try to update this list as I remember(discover) old(new) things. .
