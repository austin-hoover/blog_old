            "content": "Don&#39;t forget to spell check! . Introduction . Importance of accelerators . Particle accelerators are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as beams), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are colliders, such as the LHC, in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology also benefit tremendously from accelerators. For example, in scattering experiments a beam is collided with a target and the subsequent deflection of the beam is used to learn information about the target. This is accomplished with a neutron beam in Spallation neutron sources such as SNS, with an electron beam in electron scattering facilities such as CEBAF, or with photon beams in synchrotron light sources such as APS. . . Detector in the LHC. . Aerial view of the SNS. In addition to scientific research, accelerators find use in medicine, particularly for cancer treatment, and also in various industrial applications. . There are generally a few property of the beam which are very important to experimentalists; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the energy achieved by various machines over the past century (note on energy scale). . . There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. Accelerator physics is a field of applied physics which studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally requires years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. . Despite this complexity, the physics principles upon which these machines are built are quite simple. Most textbooks on the subject start with the motion of a particle in an accelerator under a few simplifying assumptions, so that the equations of motion have an analytic solution. This post basically sumarizes the results of such an analysis for a general audience. . Physics principles . The force on a particle in an electric field $ mathbf{E}$ and a magnetic field $ mathbf{B}$ is given by . $$ mathbf{F} = q left({ mathbf{v} times mathbf{B}} right),$$ . where $ mathbf{v}$ is the particle velocity and $q$ is the particle charge. An accelerator consists of a series of elements, each with their own electromagnetic field. The collection of these elements is called a lattice. There are three basic things we need to be able to accomplish using these fields: acceleration, steering, and focusing. Acceleration is usually achieved in a linear accelerator (linac) using a series of cavities. The electric field in these cavities oscillates back and forth along the direction of motion, as shown by this fantastic animation from Wikipedia: . . In many facilities, a beam from a linac is stored in a circular machine over many turns. . In this post we will assume this is true, i.e., . or now we will assume the particle maintains a constant speed. The next step is steering, so that we can create more complicated . We should define a coordinate system before going further. It is conventional define the $s$ axis pointing pointing along the design trajectory, and the $x$ and $y$ axes defined in the plane transverse to $s$. . . It is also conventional to use the slope, $x$&#39; . The second task, steering, is accomplished using a dipole magnetic field. A dipole field can be created by pointing the north end of one magnet to the south pole of a different magnet. The field is constant in magnitude and direction: . $$ mathbf{B}_{dipole} $$. . The problem . 1D motion . This section will describe the Courant-Snyder parameterization of 1D motion in the presence of time-dependent linear forces. . 2D motion . This section will describe the Bogacz-Lebedev parameterization of 2D motion in the presence of time-dependent + coupled linear forces. . Conclusion . This section will wrap up the post and give a preview of things to come (space charge, simulation techniques, etc.) .",
