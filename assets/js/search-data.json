            "content": "Introduction . In a previous post we examined the solutions to an equation of motion describing a parametric oscillator, which is a harmonic oscillator whose physical properties are time-dependent (but not dependent on the state of the oscillator). This problem was motivated by describing the transverse oscillations of a particle in an accelerator. In this post, the treatment will be extended to a coupled parametric oscillator. Basically, we are trying to solve the following equation of motion: . $$x&#39;&#39; + k_{11}(s)x + k_{13}(s)y + k_{14}(s)y&#39;,$$ $$y&#39;&#39; + k_{33}(s)y + k_{31}(s)x + k_{32}(s)x&#39;,$$ . where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $s$. We also assume that each of the $k_{ij}$ coefficients are periodic, so $k_{ij}(s + L) = k_{ij}(s)$ for some $L$. . Motivation . The previous post discussed dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields, which have the special property that their fields depend linearly on $x$ and $y$, and are also uncoupled. Of course there are many other configurations possible. First, consider a solenoid magnet: . . Credit: brilliant.org The field within the coils points in the longitudinal direction, and is approximatly constant ($ mathbf{B}_{sol} = B_0 hat{s}$). Plugging this into the Lorentz force equation we find: . $$ dot{ mathbf{v}} = frac{q}{m} mathbf{v} times mathbf{B} = frac{qB_0}{m} left({v_y hat{x} - v_x hat{y}} right).$$ . This means the motion in $x$ depends on the velocity in $y$, and vice versa, so this will contribute to $k_{14}$ and $k_{32}$. Next we can consider transverse magnetic fields, for which the general expression can be written as . $$B_y + iB_x = B_{ref} sum_{n=1}^{ infty} left({B_n + iA_n} right) left( frac{x + iy}{R_{ref}} right)^{n-1}.$$ . $B_{ref}$ and $R_{ref}$ are a reference field strength and radius, respectively; just consider them to be constants. We then have the normal multiple coefficients $B_n$, and the skew multipole coefficients $A_n$. The field lines corresponding to the first few normal multipole coefficients are shown below. . . Credit: Jeff Holmes . The skew multipole terms are found by rotating these fields by 45 degrees. We won&#39;t deal with anything higher than $n = 2$, since these fields contain nonlinear terms. What we will focus on is $A_2$, the skew quadrupole coefficient. This coefficient is present whenever a quadrupole magnet is tilted in the transverse plane; the result is a coupling between the motion in one plane and the position in the other, which contributes to the $k_{13}$ and $k_{31}$ terms. . Approach . Let us review the approach we took in analysing the 1D parametric oscillator. We observed that the particles travel along the boundary of an ellipse in 2D phase space, the area of which is a constant of the motion (we will denote this area by $ epsilon_x$). To understand the motion, we just need to know the dimensions and orientation of this ellipse, as well as the location of the particle on the ellipse boundary. The former is determined from the parameters: $ alpha_x$ and $ beta_x$, and the latter by the phase $ mu_x$. All the subscripts can be replaced by $y$ to handle the vertical motion. . We can also write a transfer matrix $ mathbf{M}$ from these parameters which connects the initial and final phase space coordinates after tracking through one period. This matrix can be factored into three steps: 1) deformation of the ellipse into a circle (while preserving its area), 2) rotation around the circle by the phase advance, 3) undo the original transformation. . Maybe we can do a similar thing for coupled motion. We now have four dimensions in phase space: $x$, $y$, $x&#39;$, and $y&#39;$, so we need to observe each of the 2D projections of this space (six in total). Maybe we can do something similar to the 1D case... let&#39;s track a particle in a lattice with a nonzero skew quadrupole coefficient, plotting its coordinates at one position in the lattice after every period. . The particle traces interesting donut-like shapes instead of ellipses. There are clearly two frequencies involved, which we see if we plot the $x$ and $y$ position vs period number and take the FFT. This is typical of a coupled oscillator. Usually a coupled oscillator is understood as the superposition of normal modes, each of which corresponds to a single frequency. For example, consider two masses connected with a spring. The system has a breathing mode, in which masses move in opposite directions, and a sloshing mode, in which the masses move in the same direction. The motion is simply the sum of these two modes. We will try to do something similar for a coupled parameteric oscillator. . Transfer matrix eigenvectors . Conclusion .",

            "content": "to do . Make figures the right height. | Remove figure captions? | . This post presents the solution to a general problem: what is the motion of a particle in one dimension (1D) in the presence of time-dependent linear forces? This amounts to solving the following equation of motion: . $$ frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + k(t)x = 0,$$ . where $k(t + T) = k(t)$ for some $T$. This is a parametric oscillator, a harmonic oscillator whose physical properties are not static. For example, the oscillations of a pendulum (in the small angle approximation) on the surface of a planet whose gravitational pull varies periodically would be described by the above equation. The solution to this equation was derived by George William Hill in 1886 to study lunar motion, and for this reason it is known as Hill&#39;s equation. It also finds application in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and accelerator physics. After setting up the physical problem, we will examine the solutions and discuss their relevance to the last application, accelerator physics. . Problem motivation . Particle accelerator physics . Particle accelerators are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as beams), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are colliders, such as the LHC, in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology also benefit tremendously from accelerators; this is due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments in which the deflection of a beam after colliding with a target is used to learn information about the target. The scattered beam is composed of neutrons in spallation neutron sources such as SNS, electrons in electron scattering facilities such as CEBAF, or photons in synchrotron light sources such as APS. In addition to scientific research, accelerators find use in medicine, particularly for cancer treatment, and also in various industrial applications. . . A large detector at an interaction point in the LHC. There are generally a few beam properties which are very important to experimentalists; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the energy achieved by various machines over the past century. . . Note: vertical axis scale is beam energy needed to produce the center of mass energy by collision with a resting proton. There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. Accelerator physics is a field of applied physics which studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally requires years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. We next discuss the physics principles upon which these machines are built, which are quite simple despite this complexity. . Linear model of an accelerator . There are three basic tasks an accelerator has to accomplish. First, it must increase the beam energy (acceleration). Second, it must guide the beam along a predetermined path (steering). Third, it must ensure the beam particles remain close together (focusing). How can we accomplish this? Well, particles are charged, and the force on a point charge in electromagnetic fields is given by . $$ mathbf{F} = q left({ mathbf{E} + mathbf{v} times mathbf{B}} right),$$ . where $q$ is the particle charge, $ mathbf{v}$ is the particle velocity, $ mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, and $ mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. An accelerator consists of a series of elements, each with their own $ mathbf{E}$ and $ mathbf{B}$. The collection of these elements is called a lattice. Before discussing how these fields are created, we should define a coordinate system. It is conventional to define an $s$ axis pointing pointing along the design trajectory, and the $x$ and $y$ axes defined in the plane transverse to $s$. In this way the motion is broken up into transverse ($x$ and $y$) and longitudinal ($s$) dynamics. It is also conventional to use the transverse slope $x&#39; = dx/ds$ instead of the velocity. . . The first task, acceleration, is not the focus of this post; I&#39;ll just mention the basic principles that are used. A simple method is to produce a voltage difference between two conductors, but there is a limit to the electric field strengths that can be produced in this way. The solution is to create a series of radio-frequency (RF) cavities, each with its own oscillating $ mathbf{E}$ field. The positions and lengths of these cavities are chosen so that particles are only within the cavities when the electric field is pointed along the direction of motion, as shown by this fantastic animation from Wikipedia: . . The remaining tasks, steering and focusing, concern the motion in the transverse plane. Magnetic fields, not electric fields, are used since their effect grows with increased particle energy. The magnetic field used for steering is the dipole field given by . $$ mathbf{B}_{dipole} propto hat{y}.$$ . This will simply bend the particle in a circle in the horizontal plane. A dipole field can be formed by pointing the north pole of a magnet at the south pole of a different magnet. Next, quadrupole fields are used for focusing: . $$ mathbf{B}_{quad} propto y hat{x} + x hat{y}.$$ . A quadrupole field can be obtained by overlaying two dipole fields and rotating them 90 degrees relative to each other. Below shows the magnetic field lines (black) and resulting force for on a charge moving into the page. . . The force from the quadrupole is focusing in the horizontal direction, but defocusing in the vertical direction; however, net focusing is still achieved by alternating the direction of the quadrupoles. This is analogous to a beam of light passign through a series of converging and diverging lenses. If the spacing and curvature of the lenses is correctly chosen, a net focusing can be achieved. In this sense a quadrupole acts as a magnetic lense. . . Focusing (QF) and defocusing (QD) quadrupoles modeled as magnetic lenses. Equation of motion . Dipoles and quadrupoles form the core of modern accelerators. For example, the LHC has around 1200 dipoles. This video shows a bit of the construction process for these magnets. In reality there will be no such thing as a pure dipole or quadrupole field, i.e., there will be higher order moments resulting in nonlinear forces; however, the approximation is usually reasonable. If we make this approximation, the forces from dipoles and quadrupoles are linear, meaning they are proportional to the particle position, and also uncoupled, meaning the motion in one dimension is independent of the motion in the other dimension. We thus arrive at our original equation of motion: . $$x&#39;&#39; + k(s)x = 0,$$ . where $k(s + L) = k(s)$ for some distance $L$. The period length $L$ could be the entire circumference of a circular machine, or could be a smaller repeated subsection. . Solution . Envelope function . The general solution to Hill&#39;s equation is given by . $$x(s) = sqrt{ epsilon} ,w(s) cos left({ mu(s) + delta} right).$$ . This introduces an amplitude $w(s) = w(s + L)$ which we call the envelope function, as well as a phase $ mu$, both of which depend on $s$. The constants $ epsilon$ and $ delta$ are determined by the initial conditions. Below is an example in what is known as a FODO (focus-off-defocus-off) lattice, which consists of evenly spaced focusing and defocusing quadrupoles. For now we can think of the lattice as repeating itself forever in the $s$ direction. Each black line on the right represents the trajectory for a different initial position and slope; although the individual trajectories look rather complicated, the envelope function has a very simple form. . . Phase space . The particle motion becomes much easier to interpret if we observe it in position-momentum space, aka phase space. The following animation shows the evolution of the particle phase space coordinates at a single position in the lattice. The position shown is $s = nL/4$, where $n$ is the period number, which corresponds to the midpoint between the focusing and defocusing quadrupoles. . . &lt;/input&gt; Once Loop Reflect We see that the particle jumps along the boundary of an ellipse in phase space. The shape and orientation of the ellipse will change if we look at a different position in the lattice, but its area will be the same. So, the motion is determined by the dimensions and oriention of this ellipse throughout the lattice, as well as the location of the paricle on the ellipse boundary. This motivates the definition of the so-called Twiss parameters: . $$ beta = w^2, quad alpha = - frac{1}{2} beta&#39;, quad gamma = frac{1 + alpha^2}{ beta}.$$ . The dimensions of the phase space ellipse are nicely described by these parameters: . . The maximum extent of the ellipse is determined by $ beta$ in the $x$ direction and $ gamma$ in the $y$ direction. $ alpha$ is proportional to the slope of the $ beta$ function, and so determines the tilt angle of the ellipse. The position of a particle on the ellipse is given by the phase $ mu$. Finally, the invariant of the motion corresponding to the ellipse area is constructed from the Twiss parameters as . $$ epsilon = beta {x&#39;}^2 + 2 alpha xx&#39; + gamma x^2$$ . for any $x$ and $x&#39;$. The $ beta$ functions and phase advances in both dimensions are extremely important to measure and control in a real machine. Here is an example of the horizontal and vertical $ beta$ functions in the SNS accumulator ring. . . Transfer matrices . A helpful tool to pair with the parameterization we just introduced is the transfer matrix, a matrix which connects the phase space coordinates at two different positions: . $$ begin{bmatrix} x x&#39; end{bmatrix}_{s + L} = mathbf{M} begin{bmatrix} x x&#39; end{bmatrix}_{s}$$ . The transfer matrix can be written as $ mathbf{M} = mathbf{V} mathbf{P} mathbf{V}^{-1}$, where . $$ mathbf{V} = frac{1}{ sqrt{ beta}} begin{bmatrix} beta &amp; 0 - alpha &amp; 1 end{bmatrix}$$ and $$ mathbf{P} = begin{bmatrix} cos mu &amp; sin mu - sin mu &amp; cos mu end{bmatrix} $$ . The effect of $ mathbf{V}^{-1}$ is to deform the phase space ellipse into a circle while preserving its area. $ mathbf{P}$ is then just a rotation in phase space, and $ mathbf{V}$ then transforms back into a tilted ellipse. This is illustrated below. . . $ mathbf{V}$ can be thought of as a time-dependent transformation which removes the variance in the focusing strength, turning the parametric oscillator into a simple harmonic oscillator. Often it is called the Floquet transformation. . Conclusion . We&#39;ve presented the solution to Hill&#39;s equation, which describes a parameteric oscillator. The equation pops up in multiple areas, but we focused on its application in accelerator physics. By approximating all magnetic fields as perfect dipoles or quadrupoles, the single particle dynamics in an accelerator obey Hill&#39;s equation. . In short, the solution is that particles move around the surface of an ellipse in phase space, the area of which is an invariant of the motion. The dimensions and orientation of the ellipse are determined by $ alpha$ and $ beta$, and the location of the paricle on the ellipse boundary is determined by $ mu$. These parameters can be used to construct a time-dependent transformation ($ mathbf{V}$) which turns the parametric oscillator into a simple harmonic oscillator. . The next post will examine how this treatment can be extended to include coupling between the horizontal and vertical dimensions. .",
