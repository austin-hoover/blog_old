            "content": "Don&#39;t forget to spell check! . Introduction . Particle accelerators are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as beams), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are colliders, such as the LHC, in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, biology, and medicine also benefit tremendously from accelerators due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments. In such an experiment a beam is collided with a target, and the subsequent deflection of the beam is used to learn information about the target. This is accomplished with a neutron beam in Spallation neutron sources such as SNS, with an electron beam in electron scattering facilities such as CEBAF, or with photon beams in synchrotron light sources such as APS. . | | . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; Left: a detector at an interaction point in the LHC. Right: aerial view of the SNS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; In general there are a few property of the beam which are very important to experimental scientists; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the beam energy achieved by various machines over the past century. . &lt;/p&gt; Livingston plot showing the increase in collider beam energy over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. Accelerator physics is a field of applied physics which studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally requires years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. . Despite this complexity, the physics principles upon which these machines are built are quite simple. Most textbooks on the subject start with the motion of a particle in an accelerator under a few simplifying assumptions, so that the equations of motion have an analytic solution. This post summarizes . The problem . This section will describe the physical situation we are studying, as well as all the assumptions we are making. . 1D motion . This section will describe the Courant-Snyder parameterization of 1D motion in the presence of time-dependent linear forces. . 2D motion . This section will describe the Bogacz-Lebedev parameterization of 2D motion in the presence of time-dependent + coupled linear forces. . Conclusion . This section will wrap up the post and give a preview of things to come (space charge, simulation techniques, etc.) . &lt;/div&gt; . .",
