            "title": "Linear Particle Dynamics in an Accelerator",
            "content": "Don&#39;t forget to spell check! . Particle accelerators are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as beams), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are colliders, such as the [LHC], in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, biology, and medicine also benefit tremendously from accelerators due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments. In such an experiment a beam is collided with a target, and the subsequent deflection of the beam is used to learn information about the target. This is accomplished with a neutron beam in Spallation neutron sources such as [SNS], with an electron beam in electron scattering facilities such as [CEBAF], or with photon beams in synchrotron light sources [APS]. . In general there are a few property of the beam which are very important to the scientists performing the experiment; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the log of the energy on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. . . Constructing and operating facilities such as these generally takes years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. . Introduction . This section will describe the physical situation we are studying, as well as all the assumptions we are making. . 1D motion . This section will describe the Courant-Snyder parameterization of 1D motion in the presence of time-dependent linear forces. . 2D motion . This section will describe the Bogacz-Lebedev parameterization of 2D motion in the presence of time-dependent + coupled linear forces. . Conclusion . This section will wrap up the post and give a preview of things to come (space charge, simulation techniques, etc.) .",
