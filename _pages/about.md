<header class="page-heading">{{page.title}}</header>

I started this blog because I've found that writing about a given topic is an effective way to improve my understanding of that topic. It's not meant to be a portfolio; for my more publications, CV, etc., please visit my [home page](https://austin-hoover.github.io). 

My primary interest in the STEM world is physics, particularly accelerator physics. Outside of STEM, I'm interested in philosophy, particularly philosophy of religion and philosophy of science. It's likely that most of my posts will fall under these categories.

Although I may write as if I have an audience, I'm really writing for myself. I apologize for the inevitable misspellings, grammar mistakes, and/or all-around poor style.
