title: About Me
permalink: /about/
---

I'm currently completing a PhD in physics from the [University of Tennessee, Knoxille](http://physics.utk.edu), studying high-intensity proton beam dynamics as part of the Accelerator Physics group at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS). I previously obtained a BS in physics from [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu). 

Outside of physics, I've recently enjoyed learning about machine learning through courses in the UTK computer science department, and now through self-study. My current main non-STEM interest is philosophy, particularly philosophy of religion. In my spare time, I sometimes exercise, play chess (badly), or play piano (badly).

This blog is a space for me to organize my thoughts in writing; I've found this to be a useful exercise when exploring new topics or improving my understanding of familiar topics. All my posts are categorized [here](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/categories/).
