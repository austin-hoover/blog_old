This blog is a space for me to write about technical things. Most of the time, I'll focus on my research in accelerator physics, but I'm also interested in other topics such as machine learning. Please see my homepage at [austin-hoover.github.io](https://austin-hoover.github.io) for my bio, CV, etc.
