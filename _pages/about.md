I am completing my PhD in physics from the [University of Tennessee, Knoxille](http://physics.utk.edu), working as part of the Accelerator Physics group at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns). Previously, I graduated from [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu) with a BS in physics.
