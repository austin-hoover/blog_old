<header class="page-heading">{{page.title}}</header>

The primary purpose of this blog is to improve my understanding of whatever topics I choose to write about. Although I haven't placed any constraints on the possible topics, most will fall under one of the following categories:

* Physics, particularly the area of accelerator physics.
* Statistics, data analysis, programming, etc.
* Philosophy, particularly philosophy of religion and philosophy of science.
