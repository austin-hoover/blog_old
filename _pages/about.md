I'm currently completing a PhD in physics from the [University of Tennessee, Knoxille](http://physics.utk.edu), studying high-intensity proton beam dynamics as part of the Accelerator Physics group at the [Spallation Neutron Source](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns) (SNS). I previously obtained a BS in physics from [Wheaton College](https://www.wheaton.edu). This blog is a space for me to explore technical concepts; all my posts are categorized [here](https://austin-hoover.github.io/blog/categories/).
