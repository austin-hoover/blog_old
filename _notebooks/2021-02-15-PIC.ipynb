    "In my research I utilize [PyORBIT](link), one of many particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation codes for particle accelerators. These codes track a beam of particles though the time-varying electromagnetic fields provided by an accelerator; we call this *external focusing*. In addition to external focusing, there are also *internal* forces to consider caused by the electromagnetic interactions between the beam particles. These are known as *space charge* forces, which refers to the charge density of the beam in free space. Space charge is significant in low-energy, high-intensity machines, so it is very important to be able to predict its effects.\n",
