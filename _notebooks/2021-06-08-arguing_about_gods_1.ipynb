    "I’m currently reading the book *Arguing About Gods* by Graham Oppy, one of the most prominent philosophers of religion. Oppy’s main thesis is that there are no successful arguments for the existence of orthodoxly conceived monotheistic gods, where “orthodoxly conceived monotheistic god” refers to an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator of the world. I’ll take “God” to mean the same thing."

    "This post will focus on the first chapter. Before I begin, I should mention why I’m studying this topic (the existence of God). One reason is that it’s interesting, but another reason is that my belief about the existence of God has the potential to influence my other beliefs. It is thus an important question to me. I should also mention what I hope to achieve during this study. There are many questions that I have related to the question of the existence of God (call this question *G*); here are a few:\n",
    "* Is *G* answerable?\n",
    "* How, and on what basis, do I currently answer *G*?\n",
    "* How, and on what basis, would I answer *G* if I had different background knowledge, experiences, beliefs, etc.?\n",
    "* How, and on what basis, would I answer *G* with fresh eyes, i.e., if I didn’t consider my background knowledge, experiences, beliefs, etc.?\n",
    "* How, and on what basis, would I answer *G* if I were perfectly rational?\n",
    "* How confident am I in my answer to *G*? \n",
    "* Could my answer to *G* change in the future?\n",
    "* What should I think about people who answer *G* differently than me? Are they more reasonable? Are they less reasonable?"

    "I suppose that my general goal is to think more carefully about each of these questions. I’m specifically interested in forming a more concrete answer to “How confident am I in my answer to *G*?”. Let me focus on this for a moment. It will be helpful to adopt the following metric which is discussed in the book. Suppose that I’m forming a belief about whether *S* is true or false. I’ll assign a value *x* to *S* such that *x* = 0 if I’m completely confident that *S* is false, and *x* = 1 if I’m completely confident that *S* is true. But maybe it’s better to instead say that *x* lies somewhere within the range *r* = (*p*, *q*); I might let *r* = (0.9, 1) if I’m very confident, *r* = (0, 0.1) if I’m not very confident, etc. It’s also still possible to choose a range with no width, like *r* = (0.33, 0.33)."

I think that I would choose *r* = (0.4, 0.7) at this moment in time for the following reasons. If I were unaware of any arguments for or against the existence of God, then I think that r would be symmetric about 0.5, perhaps (0.4, 0.6). I don’t think this is a good or bad thing — it’s how my brain works, which is a function of many things. I would be tempted to call this agnosticism. Nonetheless, I’m attracted by several arguments for the existence of God, and the result is that my “belief pendulum” swings farther toward theism than atheism, hence the upper bound of 0.7. "

Fourth, moral arguments appeal to the moral structure of the world. Fifth, arguments such as Pascal’s wager don’t push for the existence of God, but rather claim that belief in God is rational.

Not necessarily. For example, there could be one circular argument in the set, with the rest being good arguments. In this case, a mega-argument formed from all the arguments in the set would also be circular and hence would be weaker than any of the good arguments in isolation. The mega-argument could be stronger than any individual argument if each argument is viewed probabilistically, but Oppy thinks that this may be problematic and leaves his explanation for later chapters.

Well, the reasoning is that we generally make decisions in a Bayesian sense, evaluating the probability of the evidence given a set of prior probabilities or prior beliefs. In fact, it seems impossible not to do this, which means that every new belief is formed against the background of many other beliefs. If this is true, then, of course, we can expect disagreement between two less-than-perfectly rational people.   "

Since Alice already has a set of prior beliefs, I should form an argument whose conclusion follows from premises that Alice already believes; otherwise, I’ll need to change Alice’s mind about her prior beliefs with a separate argument that uses a different subset of Alice’s prior beliefs. We may eventually reach beliefs for which there are no appeals to other beliefs for justification (see later discussion on basic beliefs), and there is no hope of changing Alice’s mind if we disagree about those. The other thing I could do is show that Alice’s beliefs are contradictory. The main point is that it could often be the case that Alice just rejects one of my premises and that this could lead down a rabbit hole at the end of which is a fundamental difference in worldviews.

Consider a lottery with infinitely many tickets. I shouldn’t think that my ticket is the winner since the probability is infinitesimal {% fn 1 %}. This is like suspending belief that any of the God hypotheses are true. But I should believe this about each ticket, which amounts to believing that *no* ticket is the winner — a false belief. This is like suspending belief that none of the God hypotheses are true. So, I should neither believe nor disbelieve that God exists. "

My belief can’t be based on external evidence because the BIV hypothesis explains this evidence just as well as the alternative. Rather, it must be due to some internal evidence, i.e., an intuition, a feeling, or just something that I take to be true a priori; in other words, the belief is *basic*. "

    "The strong agnostic needs to make some distinction between the God hypotheses and the cases involving extreme skepticism; however, there’s no clear way to do this. Oppy notes that the best approach is probably to say that my skepticism about the external world requires me to believe that I’m special — somehow, I’m the only real thing in my perceived world — and that this gives me a reason to reject my skepticism. Call this the “I’m special” consideration ISC. However, Oppy proceeds, if the strong atheist concedes that the ISC is required to distinguish between these cases, then they have conceded that external evidence is not the only thing that can support reasonable beliefs, for the reason why the ISC should count against the truth of a belief is not clear from external evidence even though it may be clear to the strong agnostic. So, the problem is not that strong agnostics are unreasonable for liking the ISC, it’s just that they might be forced to choose between extreme skepticism and admitting that theists and atheists can be reasonable.

Any arguments for which this applies would then seem to be ineffective at changing the beliefs of non-theists.

If the idea of God’ is shown to be incoherent, it seems that we could think of God’’, God’’’, God#, etc., all of which are slightly different so that they avoid whatever problem was found with the previous god. Oppy thinks that these alternative deities could be useful to the non-theist as a defense, but not as an attack. This is because the theist likely has a set of prior beliefs that make an orthodoxly conceived monotheistic god seem the most likely to them even if they accept that some arguments don’t nail down this god’s moral character. In general, it’s supposed that we shouldn’t be forced to give up a belief just because we recognize that there are alternatives that seem just as good to a reasonable outside observer. "

I remember having long (friendly, non-serious) debates with my friends in college about various topics. I recall that, in some of these discussions, I didn’t even have a strong opinion on the topic beforehand. Yet, it was quite difficult to change the belief that I formed at the beginning of the debate. I would think: “I formed that belief five minutes ago based on my intuition, and my intuition is infallible!” In hindsight, I was obviously wrong some of the time, and the arguments I presented were likely weak. The fact that that I had a strong resistance to changing my beliefs, even though I had very little to lose by giving them up, demonstrates that it would be difficult to change my mind about my core beliefs using arguments alone."

Although this sounds uncontroversial, I think that many atheists would like to claim that there is something that is not working exactly as it should in the minds of theists, and that many theists would like to claim that there is some cognitive faculty that leads to knowledge of God which is not working correctly in the minds of atheists, for whatever reason. These accusations might sound hostile at first, but I don’t that they are. For imagine that a theist or atheist has an argument that they take to *logically rule out* the existence or non-existence of God. In that case, how can they say that the other person is reasonable to ignore this logic? It’s a good question. Oppy’s main argument in the book is that, currently, there are no such arguments. "
