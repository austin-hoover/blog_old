    "[Particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator) are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as *beams*), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are *colliders*, such as the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology also benefit tremendously from accelerators. For example, in scattering experiments a beam is collided with a target and the subsequent deflection of the beam is used to learn information about the target. This is accomplished with a neutron beam in *Spallation neutron sources* such as [SNS](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns), with an electron beam in *electron scattering facilities* such as [CEBAF](https://science.osti.gov/np/Facilities/User-Facilities/CEBAF), or with photon beams in *synchrotron light sources* such as [APS](https://www.aps.anl.gov). In addition to scientific research, accelerators find use in [medicine](http://www.accelerators-for-society.org/health/index.php?id=7), particularly for cancer treatment, and also in various [industrial applications](http://www.accelerators-for-society.org/industry/index.php?id=8)."

    "There are generally a few property of the beam which are very important to experimentalists; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the energy achieved by various machines over the past century (note on energy scale)."

    "There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. *Accelerator physics* is a field of applied physics which studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally requires years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this complexity, the physics principles upon which these machines are built are quite simple. Most textbooks on the subject start with the motion of a particle in an accelerator under a few simplifying assumptions, so that the equations of motion have an analytic solution. This post basically sumarizes the results of such an analysis for a general audience."

Acceleration is usually achieved in a linear accelerator (linac) using a series of cavities. The electric field in these cavities oscillates back and forth along the direction of motion, as shown by this fantastic animation from Wikipedia:"

In this sense the quadrupoles act as magnetic lenses, as illustrated below."

    "The elements we just listed, dipoles and quadrupoles, provide the core of most modern accelerators, and they all have the nice property that the force they exert is proportional to the displacement. An alternative way to say this is that the fields are *linear*. This reminds us of the system we all know and love: the harmonic oscillator. Of course, this is an approximation, and in reality the fields will contain higher order moments; however, in most cases it is a pretty good approximation, and making it allows us to write down exactly the position and momentum of a particle at every position in the lattice.
