    "[Particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator) are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as *beams*), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are *colliders*, such as the [LHC], in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, biology, and medicine also benefit tremendously from accelerators due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments. In such an experiment a beam is collided with a target, and the subsequent deflection of the beam is used to learn information about the target. This is accomplished with a neutron beam in *Spallation neutron sources* such as [SNS], with an electron beam in *electron scattering facilities* such as [CEBAF], or with photon beams in *synchrotron light sources* [APS].  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general there are a few property of the beam which are very important to the scientists performing the experiment; in colliders it is the energy and luminosity, in spallation sources it is the intensity, and in light sources it is the brightness. There is thus a constant need to push these parameters to new regions. For example, below is the famous Livingston plot which shows the log of the energy on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. "
