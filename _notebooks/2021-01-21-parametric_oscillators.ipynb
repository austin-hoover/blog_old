The solution to this equation was derived by [George William Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Hill) in 1886 to study lunar motion, and for this reason it is known as *Hill's equation*. It also finds application in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum optics, and accelerator physics. After setting up the physical problem, we will examine the solutions and discuss their relevance to the last application, accelerator physics."

    "[Particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator) are machines which produce groups of charged particles (known as *beams*), increase their kinetic energy, and guide them to a target. These machines are invaluable to modern scientific research. The most famous examples are *colliders*, such as the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), in which two beams are smashed together to generate fundamental particles. A lesser known fact is that the fields of condensed matter physics, material science, chemistry, and biology also benefit tremendously from accelerators; this is due to the effectiveness of scattering experiments in which the deflection of a beam after colliding with a target is used to learn information about the target. The scattered beam is composed of neutrons in *spallation neutron sources* such as [SNS](https://neutrons.ornl.gov/sns), electrons in *electron scattering facilities* such as [CEBAF](https://science.osti.gov/np/Facilities/User-Facilities/CEBAF), or photons in *synchrotron light sources* such as [APS](https://www.aps.anl.gov). In addition to scientific research, accelerators find use in [medicine](http://www.accelerators-for-society.org/health/index.php?id=7), particularly for cancer treatment, and also in various [industrial applications](http://www.accelerators-for-society.org/industry/index.php?id=8)."

    "There are many physics issues associated with the optimization of these beam parameters. *Accelerator physics* is a field of applied physics which studies these issues. The task of the accelerator physicist is to understand, control, and measure the journey of the beam from its creation to its final destination. The difficulty of this task has grown over time; the improvement accelerator performance has brought with it a staggering increase in size and complexity. The construction and operation of modern accelerators generally requires years of planning, thousands of scientists and engineers, and hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. We next discuss the physics principles upon which these machines are built, which are quite simple despite this complexity."

Before discussing how these fields are created, we should define a coordinate system. It is conventional to define an $s$ axis pointing pointing along the design trajectory, and the $x$ and $y$ axes defined in the plane transverse to $s$. In this way the motion is broken up into transverse ($x$ and $y$) and longitudinal ($s$) dynamics. It is also conventional to use the transverse slope $x' = dx/ds$ instead of the velocity.\n",
